# Tests

This directory contains tests for the LANPWNER framework.

## Running Tests

You can run all tests using pytest:

```
pytest lanpwner/tests
```

These tests ensure that all modules are importable and basic structure is intact. Expand with functional and integration tests as the framework develops.
